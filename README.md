# Student Percentage Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes student percentage data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It processes the provided dataset to calculate and visualize student performance.

## Files Included
- **Student_dataset.xlsx**: Contains student-related data, possibly including scores and other relevant details.
- **Copy of Student_percentage.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that processes the dataset to compute and analyze student percentages.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (if visualization is included)

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to `Copy of Student_percentage.ipynb` and open it.
3. Run the cells to load and analyze the dataset.

## Expected Output
- Calculation of student percentages
- Possible data visualizations (if included in the notebook)

## Notes
- Ensure the `Student_dataset.xlsx` file is in the same directory as the notebook.
- Modify the notebook as needed to suit different datasets.
